# ImageAutoEncoder

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to build a variational autoencoder (VAE) for images captured by a vehicle's front camera. A VAE is a type of neural network that can learn to compress data into a lower-dimensional representation and then use that representation to reconstruct the original data. In the case of this repository, the VAE will be used to compress vehicle images and then reconstruct them.

We tested this using synthetic data generated by the Autodrive simulator, which can be found here: https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/AutoDRIVE-Nigel-Dataset.git
Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Dump all of your image data into the Data folder. The images should be in JPEG format.
    Install the necessary Python libraries. The required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file.
    Run train.py to train the VAE on your image data. The trained model will be saved to disk as vae.h5.

# Results

Once you've trained the VAE, you can use it to reconstruct images from your test set. Here's an example of what the reconstructed images might look like:

In the image above, you can see the original post-compressed (56x56 pixel) image on the left and the predicted image on the right. The latent space for the image is of dimension 5.
